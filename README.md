Plot Latest COVID-19
---

I'm tired of incomplete graphs and politicized plots that fail to take
population size into account when it is convenient for the agenda of the
article. I've created this project to download, parse, analyze and plot
current COVID-19 statistics. My goal is to put some of the plots on this
project page. So far, I'm just using it for personal interest. Feel free to
use it if you would like.
